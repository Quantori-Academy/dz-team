-   [ ] User authentication and authorization with role-based access control
-   [ ] Sample tracking and management
-   [ ] Substances management
-   [ ] Equipment management
-   [ ] Storage management
-   [ ] Laboratories management
-   [ ] Reports and statistics generation

## Getting started

1. Clone the repository
2. Open project root directory in an IDE of your choice
3. Run `yarn` to install dependencies - see more in the [Package manager and monorepo](#package-manager-and-monorepo) section
4. Run `yarn dev` to start the development server
5. Open `http://localhost:5173` in your browser to see the app

## Vibes and mindset

This project is a part of Quantori Academy JS course 2024, set to mimic a real-world project experience. **'Realistic'** means we're going for a quality product in a predefined time frame.

We're not aiming for perfection - it's 1) impossible and b) unnecessary.
We're aiming for a quality product, realistic workflow, good developer experience and many opportunities to learn and grow.
We're building a cool, complicated thing, working as a team, catching up with great technologies, taking on challenges, making soft and hard mistakes, fixing them and moving on. This should be fun and functional, much like anything we do in life.

Remember to tell your employer the opposite though. Your weaknesses are perfectionism and being an workaholic ðŸ˜‰

<!-- Is that too informal? As representatives of Q, can we joke about it? -->

Here are a couple of things to keep in mind:

-   You're smart. When you feel like it, enjoy it. When you don't, know that at the very least you're smart enough. Get a coffee, take a walk, and rock on. You got this.
-   We need team players more than we need geniuses. Unless you're a genius team player, in which case, we need you the most ðŸš€
-   When you receive feedback, you grow. When you give feedback, you grow even more. Good, constructive, friendly feedback's the best help you can give.
-   Talk! Every team is different, but a team where questions and propositions are discouraged is not a team. It's a dead end. Be brave, make friends, shine yourself and let others shine too. Networking is not overrated.
-   Don't stop. Making mistakes fast is better than not moving at all. If you find yourself stuck on something for >30 minutes of active work, take a break, come back, look again and if no magic happens, ask for help.

## Workflow

Our task management is based on the [Scrum](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum_(software_development)>) methodology. This is a very common approach in the industry, so getting familiar with it is an extremely valuable experience.

We have 2-week sprints, with a **planning** meeting at the beginning of each sprint, and a **retrospective** at the end. Daily stand-ups are ommited in favor of asynchronous communication in the form of **daily updates in the main Teams channel**. <!-- TODO: add link after channel is created -->

We use [GitHub Projects](https://github.com/orgs/Quantori-Academy/projects/10) to manage our tasks and track our progress.

Please make sure to follow the following task workflow:

-   Select a task from the "To do" column
-   Assign yourself to the task
-   Move the task to the "In progress" column
-   Create a new branch with the following naming convention: `feature/feature-name`, `fix/bug-name`, `chore/task-name` or `docs/task-name`
-   Work on the task, commit your changes, and push them to GitHub
-   If you need any help with the task, create a draft pull request and message the team in the main Teams channel or ping a mentor
-   Once the task is completed, create a pull request or convert the draft pull request to a regular one, then move the task to "In Review" column
-   After at least one mentor has reviewed and approved the pull request, make sure to resolve all the comments and link the pull request to the issue, then merge the PR and move the task to "Done" column

Don't worry about PR flow at the moment - you will find out that our repository has a PR template that has all the necessary steps to follow.

## Git workflow

We use [Feature Branches](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/feature-branch-workflow). It is a lightweight workflow that inspires team discussions and fits projects where deployments are made regularly. It is also a great way to ensure that the master branch is always in a deployable state.

There are four important rules to follow:

-   **Never push directly to the main branch**. All changes must be made through pull requests - this is how all changes are reviewed and main branch is in the best possible state.
-   **Follow the naming convention for branches**. Use branch folder prefixes like `feature/`, `fix/`, `chore/`, `docs/` - it makes source control cleaner and easier to navigate.
-   **Use squashing**. When merging a pull request, make sure to `squash and merge` the PR - it keeps the commit history easy to read.
-   **Avoid large pull requests**. If a pull request is over 200 lines of meaningful code changes, it's a good idea to split it into smaller, more manageable PRs. Lines of `yarn.lock` changes, generated files and so on don't count, although some specific changes, like formatting or moving files between directories are better off in separate PRs. Try to look at the PR from the reviewer's perspective.

## CI/CD

We use GitHub Actions for continuous integration and continuous deployment. The CI/CD pipeline is minimal in this project. Usually it runs unit and integration tests, deploys the app depending on project deployment strategy, triggers bots, sends notifications to the team, and so on. For our project it builds and deploys the application to the VM on manual trigger.

## Package manager and monorepo

The repository is managed with yarn workspaces. It allows us to manage multiple packages in a single repository, and share dependencies between them - you will see that only `node_modules` in the root directory has the dependencies, and `node_modules` in the packages are symlinks to the root `node_modules`. Most notably for day-to-day work - we only use a top-level linter and formatter (ESLint, Prettier) for both frontend and backend packages.

It is important to use Yarn classic (1.x) - it is an industry standard and it's useful to get the hang of it, and while Yarn modern (3.x, 4.x) has many new features, it's not yet widely adopted mostly due to it's dependency on nodeJS _experimental_ feature Corepack.

Run `npm install yarn -g` to install Yarn classic globally. If you have Corepack enabled, you will have local package manager set to yarn classic as specified in `packageManager` field in `package.json`.

## Possible issues

If you encounter anything that blocks you from working on the project for more than 30 minutes, please reach out to the team in the main Teams channel. <!-- TODO: add link after channel is created -->

That said, here are some things you might encounter:

-   `Cannot find module 'yarn'`: most likely you have no global Yarn classic installed. Run `npm install yarn -g` to install it.
-   ESLint errors on every file: make sure you've opened the project in root directory, not `packages/frontend` or `packages/backend`. IDEs will not recognize the root linter and formatter configs if you open a subdirectory.
