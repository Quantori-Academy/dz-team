### Typical workflow

1. Define Zod schemas based on Prisma models for database entities.
2. Use these schemas for:
    - API request/response validation in Fastify routes
    - Form validation in React components
    - Runtime type checking in business logic
3. Generate TypeScript types from Zod schemas to ensure consistency.
4. Implement custom validation logic within Zod schemas as needed.

### Integration with the project

1. Add a `shared` workspace in `package.json`:

```json
    "workspaces": [
        "packages/be",
        "packages/fe",
        "packages/shared"
    ],
```

2. Add a `shared` package in `packages/` directory

3. Add a `zod-schemas.ts` to the `packages/shared` directory

4. Install `zod` in `shared` workspace only:\
   `yarn workspace shared add zod`

-   In order to avoid dependency duplication, we need to install them only where required

5. Install `fastify-type-provider-zod` in `be` workspace only:\
   `yarn workspace be add fastify-type-provider-zod`

6. Since `fastify-type-provider-zod` requires `zod` as a peer dependency, install `zod` in `be` workspace also:\
   `yarn workspace be add zod`

7. Modify `tsconfig.json` to fix the import error in `zod-schemas.ts`:

```json
    "compilerOptions": {
        "moduleResolution": "Node10"
    }

```

### Required upgrades

-   `fastify-type-provider-zod@^4.0.1` requires `fastify@^5.0.0`:\
    `yarn workspace be add fastify@^5.0.0`

-   `fastify-cors` should also be updated:\
    `yarn workspace be add @fastify/cors`
