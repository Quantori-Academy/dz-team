# Research summary on validation libraries with Prisma in React-Fastify-TypeScript stack

## Why use a validation library with Prisma

1. Runtime type checking
2. Input validation before database operations
3. API contract enforcement
4. Custom validation rules
5. Enhanced developer experience

## Prisma vs validation libraries

Prisma and validation libraries like `zod` serve different purposes, though they can complement each other in a project.

### **Prisma**
- Prisma is an ORM (Object-Relational Mapper) focused on database interaction. It automatically generates TypeScript types based on your database schema.
- While Prisma ensures type safety at the database level (compile-time validation), its validation capabilities are relatively minimal at runtime.
- It mainly focuses on data integrity with the database, like enforcing constraints on fields (e.g., required fields, unique values).

### **Validation Libraries** (`zod`, `typebox`, etc..)
- These libraries are designed for validating user input or data within your application (like form validation or API request validation).
- They allow for complex, fine-grained control over how data is validated beyond what the database enforces (e.g., regex patterns, conditional logic).
- Validation libraries often provide better, more specific error messages for invalid inputs, which is useful for frontend validation or API response errors.
- While Prisma handles database validation, libraries like `zod` are used to validate inputs before they even reach the database.
- Validation libraries work at the application layer, while Prisma works at the database layer.
- Validation libraries allow for validation logic that isn't strictly tied to database schema, which is useful for front-end validation or API data validation before it hits the database layer.

### Since our project relies heavily on forms, tables, fields, user input and requests, runtime validation is necessary to ensure that the data being entered or processed is accurate, secure, and in the correct format.


## Comparison of validation libraries

Comparing Zod, Joi, Yup, TypeBox and class-validator:

### Shared schema capability
- **Zod & TypeBox**: Excellent, designed for TypeScript
- **Yup**: Very good
- **Joi**: Good, requires setup for TypeScript
- **class-validator**: Limited, class-based

### Ease of use
- **Zod**: Intuitive, TypeScript-focused
- **TypeBox**: Straightforward, aligned with TypeScript
- **Yup**: User-friendly
- **Joi**: Powerful but verbose
- **class-validator**: Easy for classes, less flexible otherwise

### TypeScript integration
- **Zod & TypeBox**: First-class support
- **Yup**: Good support
- **Joi**: Requires additional typings
- **class-validator**: Native but limited to classes

### Performance
- **Zod & TypeBox**: Excellent
- **Yup & Joi**: Good
- **class-validator**: Varies

### Prisma integration
- **Zod**: Seamless
- **TypeBox**: Good potential
- **Others**: Require more setup

### Client-side and server-side availability
- **Zod**: Excellent for both, easily shareable schemas
- **TypeBox**: Great for both, designed for full-stack use
- **Yup**: Good for both, popular in React ecosystems
- **Joi**: Primarily server-side, can be used client-side with setup
- **class-validator**: Better suited for server-side, can be used client-side

## Recommendation: Zod

Zod is recommended for its:
1. TypeScript-first approach
2. Excellent Prisma integration
3. Strong performance
4. Intuitive API
5. Growing ecosystem
6. Seamless use in both client-side and server-side

TypeBox is a strong alternative, especially for JSON Schema-heavy projects and full-stack TypeScript applications.

There is also Valibot, a new validation library which is growing in popularity. It is heavily inspired by Zod, but uses separate functions in order to keep the bundle size to a minimum.
Since it is a new library and the community around it is not so large it was not considered for the project and not included in this research.

*Note on Zod's performance:*

There is [this](https://dev.to/nicklucas/typescript-runtime-validators-and-dx-a-type-checking-performance-analysis-of-zodsuperstructyuptypebox-5416) benchmarking test of validation libraries from early 2023, which says:
>What I learned is that Zod's performance is okay at the start, but when you start using methods like .extend/.pick/.omit (and so on) the performance regresses in the order of a magnitude.

Things might have changed since then though.
[Here](https://codetain.com/blog/benchmark-of-node-js-validators/) is a newer benchmark which shows Zod performing much better compared to other libraries.
