# Proposal: Schema Validation Solution for our project

## Project Needs

1. Full-stack TypeScript application (React frontend, Fastify backend)
2. Prisma as ORM for database operations
3. Consistent validation across client and server
4. Type safety and runtime validation
5. Efficient development process
6. Good performance in both browser and Node.js environments

## Proposed Solution: Zod

### Reasoning

1. **TypeScript Integration**

    - Zod is built from the ground up for TypeScript, providing excellent type inference.
    - This aligns perfectly with our full-stack TypeScript architecture.

2. **Prisma Compatibility**

    - Zod can easily generate schemas from Prisma models.
    - This ensures consistency between database schema and validation rules.

3. **Shared Schemas**

    - Zod schemas can be effortlessly shared between frontend and backend.
    - This maintains a single source of truth for data structures across the stack.

4. **Runtime Validation**

    - Zod provides runtime type checking, complementing TypeScript's compile-time checks.
    - This ensures data integrity during application execution.

5. **Performance**

    - Zod offers excellent runtime performance in both browser and Node.js environments.
    - This is crucial for responsive user interfaces and efficient API endpoints.

6. **Developer Experience**

    - Zod's intuitive API improves developer productivity.
    - Its growing ecosystem provides additional tools and plugins.

7. **Size and Bundling**
    - Zod is relatively lightweight, making it suitable for both server and client-side use without significantly impacting bundle size.
